                <p> Numerical Answer Type questions carry 1 or 2 marks each in most of the GATE papers and sections. For these type of questions, the answer is a <b> real number </b> that needs to be entered by the candidate with the help of virtual numeric keypad displayed on the monitor. No choices will be shown for Numerical Answer Type (NAT) Questions. The answer can be a number such as 10 or -10 (an integer only). The answer for these type of questions may also be in decimals, for example, 10.1 (one decimal) or 10.01 (two decimals) or -10.001 (three decimals). These type of questions will always be mentioned with, up to which decimal places, the candidates have to consider the answer. Also, for some NAT type of problems an appropriate range will be considered while evaluating so that the candidates are not unduly penalized for the usual round-off errors. Candidates are advised to do the rounding off at the end of the calculation (not in between steps). Wherever required and possible, it is better to give NAT answer up to a maximum of three decimal places.</p>
